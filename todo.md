- Make optional validations for password field in form handler:
    - have several stages of checks for password being: 
        - over n chars
        - having a number
        - having a non-alphanumeric component
        - other?
    - change color of text or something based on how many conditions are met
    - have text appear suggesting what to fix
    - but don't require anything except being over a low number of chars.
    - this is separate from backend validation
